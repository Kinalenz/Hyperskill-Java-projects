This is the **My First Project with Java** project I made myself.

**About**
<p>Imagine that you're the owner of a new small corner shop. You are doing well and want to determine how much you earned in the first month. Create a simple tool that will calculate your net income. Upon completing this project, you can use this tool for your own accounting needs.</p>
