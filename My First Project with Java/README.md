This is the *My First Project with Java* project I made myself.

**About**
<p>Imagine that you're the owner of a new small corner shop. You are doing well and want to determine how much you earned in the first month. Create a simple tool that will calculate your net income. Upon completing this project, you can use this tool for your own accounting needs.</p>

**Examples**

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input: It is just used to separate the user input from the output of your program in the stage examples, you don't need to print the > sign!
<p>
Example 1: the user inputs 2000 for staff expenses and 205 for other expenses accordingly:

Earned amount:<br>
Bubblegum: $202<br>
Toffee: $118<br>
Ice cream: $2250<br>
Milk chocolate: $1680<br>
Doughnut: $1075<br>
Pancake: $80<br>
<br>
Income: $5405<br>
Staff expenses:<be>
\> 2000<br>
Other expenses:<br>
\> 205<br>
Net income: $3200<br>
<br>
Example 2: the user inputs 5203 for staff expenses and 400 for other expenses accordingly:<br>
<br>

Bubblegum: $202<br>
Toffee: $118<br>
Ice cream: $2250<br>
Milk chocolate: $1680<br>
Doughnut: $1075<br>
Pancake: $80<br>
<br>
